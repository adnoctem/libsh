# BASH Library - Executables

The files contained in this `bin` directory are self-contained Bash executables which you may download and use at will.
You can use any familiar tool like `curl` or `wget` to download these executables and make them executable on your
system. Afterward the respective tool will be fully usable to you or tell you otherwise since it includes the required
functions from `lib` within.

## âœ¨ TL;DR

```shell
# with curl
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fmjstudios/bashlib/main/bin/libtree && chmod +x libtree
```

```shell
# with wget
wget --no-check-certificate --content-disposition https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fmjstudios/bashlib/main/bin/libtree && \
chmod +x libtree
```
