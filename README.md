A library of open-source [MIT][license]-licensed [Bash][bash] scripts written and maintained by `FMJ Studios` for use
with [Bash][bash] version 5 and above. Refer to the GNU Projects's in-depth [Bash Documentation][bash_docs] for more
information on how these scripts work. Scripts meant for direct execution by the user, an init system or other means of
automation are located in the [`scripts`](scripts) directory. The [`lib`](lib) directory contains library scripts meant
to be re-used across files or even different repositories with things like [Git Submodules][git_submodules] or _contrib_
scripts like [git_subtree]. You may of course take a look at other repositories of ours for tips on how to achieve
re-use.

## ‚ú® TL;DR

```shell
./scripts/run.sh Arg1 # look at any shell tutorial if this confuses you
```
